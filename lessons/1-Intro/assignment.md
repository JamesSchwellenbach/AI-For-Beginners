# Game Jam

Games are an area that have been heavily influence by developments in AI and ML. In this assignment, write a short paper on a game that you like that has been influenced by the evolution of AI. It should be an old enough game to have been influenced by several types of computer processing systems. A good example is Chess or Go, but also take a look at video games like pong or Pac-Man. Write an essay that discusses the game's past, present, and AI future.

Chess AI has gotten more and more advanced over the years, starting out with very basic AI that wasn't capable of beating top players, to now with Leela and stockfish that are rated higher than the highest chess players. Chess seems too complex a game to solve, and chess bots haven't solved it yet, but any gamestate with 7 or less pieces has been solved.
